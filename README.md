# 🌐 Network Security Scanner with Firewall Rule Simulator

A real-time network security scanner and traffic control simulator built with **Python (Flask)**, **Flask-SocketIO**, and **Nmap**. Built to understand how network scanning and firewall logic actually work under the hood, the same core concepts used in tools like Nmap and pfSense, through a fully interactive, live web interface.

## Overview

This project provides an educational, hands-on sandbox for exploring network-level security concepts. Users can:

- Run live port scans in multiple modes (TCP SYN, UDP, service version detection)
- Create and manage firewall simulation rules (`allow` / `deny`) by IP and port
- Watch traffic get filtered in real time based on the rules applied
- See, visually and interactively, how firewall logic actually shapes what traffic gets through

I built this to go beyond just using scanning tools like Nmap and firewall interfaces like pfSense, and actually understand the mechanics behind them: how a scan differentiates open, closed, and filtered ports, and how firewall rule ordering and matching decide what traffic is allowed through.

**This isn't just a visual simulation.** When run with elevated privileges, adding a "deny" rule executes a real system-level firewall command, `netsh advfirewall` on Windows or `iptables` on Linux, actually blocking the specified IP and port at the OS level, not just in the UI. Removing the rule reverses it the same way.

## 🔧 Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.11
- `nmap` installed on your system
  - **Linux**: `sudo apt install nmap`
  - **macOS**: `brew install nmap`
  - **Windows**: [Download from nmap.org](https://nmap.org/download.html)
- Administrator (Windows) or root/sudo (Linux) privileges, required for the app to apply real firewall rules rather than just simulate them

### Setup

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-SocketIO python-nmap
```

## 💡 Features

**🔍 Flexible Scanning**
- TCP SYN scan
- UDP scan
- Service version detection

**🛡️ Simulated + Real Firewall Enforcement**
- Add allow or deny rules by IP and port
- When run with admin/root privileges, deny rules are applied as real `netsh` (Windows) or `iptables` (Linux) rules, actually blocking traffic at the OS level
- Remove rules dynamically, real and simulated
- Visualize rule impact on live scan results
- When run with administrator/root privileges, deny rules can enforce real OS-level port blocking, not just simulated visualization

**⚡ Real-Time UI**
- WebSocket-driven updates, no manual refresh needed

**🌙 Dark UI Theme**
- Responsive, accessible interface

## 🚀 How to Use

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser:

1. Enter a target IP address or hostname
2. Select a scan type (TCP, UDP, or version detection)
3. Click **Start Scan**
4. Add firewall rules to block or allow specific traffic
5. Watch results update live as rules are applied

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Networking and cybersecurity education
- Visual demonstration of firewall rule behavior
- Hands-on exploration of WebSockets and real-time interaction with Flask

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Firewall rule commands are built from user input and passed through `shell=True`, without input sanitization. This is a command injection risk if the tool were ever exposed beyond a local, trusted environment. Fine for the educational/local scope this was built for, but a good example of why input validation matters before anything like this touches a real network-facing service.
- Real firewall rule application currently only supports Windows (`netsh`) and Linux (`iptables`); no macOS support yet.
